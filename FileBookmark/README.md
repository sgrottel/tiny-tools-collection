This is not a Windows Explorer shell extension.
It is a simple, normal application which writes to the right places in the registry.
Simple, not elegant, but working.

## FileBookmark.exe
The C++ application to mainly handle `.bookmark` files, quickly and directly.
It can:

* Register and unregister the `.bookmark` file type
* It can open a `.bookmark` file, and offers multiple quick actions:
    * Opening the bookmarked file
    * Moving the bookmark to the next file and optionally opening it.
    * Unbookmarking the current file, but not removing the `.bookmark` file from the directory.
      This is useful to keep the history of the bookmarked files, but not marking any file as current.
    * Opening the FileBookmark UI for additional interactions.


## FileBookmarkUI.exe
The CSharp application to show the contents of a `.bookmark` file graphically.
This way, the user can see the history of a bookmark.

TODO


## `.bookmark` Files
The `.bookmark` files are YAML files storing the history of all files bookmarked in this directory.
Core assumption is that there is only one `.bookmark` file in each directory.
When a file is bookmarked, the `.bookmark` file is changed to reference the file from it's content and is renamed to match the file name for the file bookmarked.
