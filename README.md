Assortment of tiny, tiny tools.

These are independent tools.
Each one is too tiny to justify a repository of it's own.

## AllGitsInfo
Powershell script to iterate over all git repositories and print some configuration values, like user, origin, signing.

## Beep
`MessageBeep(MB_OK);`

## CallStackUtility
Little C++ helper class to fetch a call stack, e.g. used for better error reporting and logging.

## ConProgBar
A c++ progress bar for console applications.
As usually, only semi-robust, but good enough.

## DimMon

The idea is to dim "other" monitors when watching a video or playing a game one only one of the monitors.

## GithubOverview
A powershell script to print an overview of my stuff on Github.
[Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) must be installed.

## HWndToFront
Brings a window to front in Windows 11.
Can also start an application and bring that's window to front.

## LoginWhen
Queries the Windows event log to print when the user sessions logged in and logged out.

## StartPwsh
Trivial tool to start Pwsh.exe and provide an icon. Because...

## _doc
Some more generic documentation files, e.g. including images.

## License
All tools are open source and can be used freely.

In general, and explicitly for all tools not specifying a license in their subdirectory, all code within this repositiory is published under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).

Some tools explicitly specify a license, mostly Apache License version 2.0.
In those cases, consider those tools to be dual licensed under [MIT license](./LICENSE) and the explicitly specifed license.
You can then use the tool under the terms of one of those licences, as you choose.

I doubt, feel free to ask.
