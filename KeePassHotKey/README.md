# KeePass HotKey
Wrapper utility to open a KeePass DB or trigger the Auto-Type Feature

<img src="./KeePass_Square_BW.ico" alt="KeePass_Square_BW" width="64px" style="float: right" />

This utility is _very_ specific to my use case:

- I want to trigger one action from a dedicated hardware key on my keyboard
- This action should either open a specific KeePass data base file, configured by the user, or
- Trigger the "auto-type selected" feature of KeePass, if a KeePass instance is open, running, and has a selected entry.

Note, that for the condition of triggering the "auto-type selected" feature, it is not required that the running KeePass instance has the same data base opened as is configured for the first workflow.
